# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

# Oyin_E-commerce-backend

## Description
Our challenge this week is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. We need to take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## How To Use
* This is a functional Express.js API
* User adds their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
* Then user is able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* When user enter schema and seed commands
* Then user is presented with a development database which is created and seeded with test data
* When User enters the command to invoke the application
* Then server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
* When user opens API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
* Then the the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* When user test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
* Then user is able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
